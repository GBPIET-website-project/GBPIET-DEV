                    <p class="para">The most common mode of transport is either bus or taxi. Bus services are provided by the state-run Uttarakhand Roadways, Garhwal Motor Owner Union (GMOU) Ltd. and Garhwal Mandal Vikas Nigam (GMVN) Ltd. Operations of the Uttarakhand Roadways are limited mainly to Inter-state routes and major cities/towns of the district/state. GMOU Ltd. is the largest bus service provider of the district, providing services to almost all places of the district. The services of GMU Ltd. are limited to comparatively smaller area adjoining the Kumaon division. Also there are a number of Taxi Unions in many towns of the district, providing services for almost every stretch of the road. The only railway station of the district is at Kotdwara, which was established by the British as early as 1889. As Pauri Garhwal district is situated at the Shiwalik range, the outermost range of the Himalayas, its hills are very inconsistent. As a result it is not considered feasible to extend the railways network. Pauri Garhwal district does not have any regular air services. The nearest airport is Jollygrant, Dehradun, about 155 km from Pauri and about 120 km from Kotdwara.
